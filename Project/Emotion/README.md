### Possible Ideas

* Display all data on a graph and be able to right click on a song and hit 'show' (or something like it). This will then grey out al data except for the colour of the mood for this song.
* Make a playlist; show a graph for user to pick two points and select max amount of songs. Then calculate playlist near the line and give playlist.
