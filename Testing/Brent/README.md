<h2>We Have Data!</h2>
This contains all the files that were used to mine our training data.
Training data can be foudn in ev_output.csv in the format of [mood, spotify_uri, valence, energy].

If you want to use the python script (mine.py), you will need to enter keys into settings.json as technically I am not allowed to distribute mine.
Go to https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/ and make an app to get your keys.
In playlists, you can make a new mood and add playlists (it's json...) and of course you can edit the current mood playlists for your testing.
